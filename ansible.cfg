This can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled, however when using “sudo:” operations you must first disable ‘requiretty’ in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts.

If set to True, we can cause scp to be used to transfer remote files instead here's really no reason to change this unless problems are encountered, and then there’s also no real drawback to managing the switch. Most environments support SFTP by default and this doesn’t usually need to be changed.
