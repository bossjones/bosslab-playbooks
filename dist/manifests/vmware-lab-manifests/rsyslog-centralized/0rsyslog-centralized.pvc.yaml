# ReadWriteOnce - Mount a volume as read-write by a single node
# ReadOnlyMany - Mount the volume as read-only by many nodes
# ReadWriteMany - Mount the volume as read-write by many nodes
# The rare case is ReadWriteMany because only a few storage providers have the support for it. Think of ReadWriteMany as NFS.
